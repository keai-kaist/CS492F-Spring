    "In other words, our model would _overfit to the training data_. Learning how to deal with overfitting is important. Although it's often possible to achieve high accuracy on the training set, what we really want is to develop models that generalize well to a testing set (or data they haven't seen before). If you train for too long though, the model will start to overfit and learn patterns from the training data that don't generalize to the test data. We need to strike a balance. Understanding how to train for an appropriate number of epochs as we'll explore below is a useful skill.\n",

    "To prevent overfitting, the best solution is to use more training data. A model trained on more data will naturally generalize better. When that is no longer possible, the next best solution is to use techniques like _regularization_. These place constraints on the quantity and type of information your model can store. If a network can only afford to memorize a small number of patterns, the optimization process will force it to focus on the most prominent patterns, which have a better chance of generalizing well.\n",

    "#### Demonstrate overfitting by model size\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to prevent overfitting is to reduce the size of the model, i.e. the number of learnable parameters in the model. In deep learning, the number of learnable parameters in a model is often referred to as the model's **\"_capacity_\"**. Intuitively, a model with more parameters will have more \"memorization capacity\" and therefore will be able to easily learn a perfect dictionary-like mapping between training samples and their targets, **a mapping without any generalization power, but this would be useless when making predictions on previously unseen data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the **network has limited memorization resources**, it will not be able to learn the mapping as easily. To minimize its loss, **it will have to learn compressed representations that have more predictive power.** At the same time, if you make your model too small, **it will have difficulty fitting to the training data.** There is a balance between \"too much capacity\" and \"not enough capacity\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To find an appropriate model size empirically, it's best to start with relatively few layers and parameters, then begin increasing the size of the layers or adding new layers until you see diminishing returns on the validation loss. Let's try this on our movie review classification network.\n",
